# AI Copilot Logic Layer: Concept Notes

## Overview
The AI Copilot layer uses pattern recognition and behavior modeling to monitor DeFi smart contracts in real-time. It acts as a guardian against logic-based exploits and manipulation.

## Key Features
- Behavioral pattern tracking
- Alerting and auto-pause features
- Learning loop from prior exploits

## Decision Tree (simplified)
1. Monitor contract behavior
2. Match against anomaly library
3. Trigger alerts or pausing mechanism
