# AI Copilot Guardian for DeFi 🔐🧠

**A real-time AI logic layer for DeFi contract security and reasoning.**  
Born from the Fatbrain Store #13 vision — evolved to protect decentralized finance.

## 🔗 Linked Vision
This prototype extends the concepts of cultural encryption and blockchain memory from our [Culture Encryption Blockchain Repo]([ttps://github.com/fatbrain1/culture-encryption-blockchain).

## 🔍 What It Does
- Monitors smart contracts in real-time  
- Detects abnormal behavior or logic exploits  
- Flags or auto-pauses malicious actions  
- Integrates with cognitive-level incentive systems like Thinking Coin  

## 📂 Structure
- `guardian_ai.py` – AI behavioral logic engine  
- `sim_exploit_case.py` – Recreated Cetus-style attack for testing  
- `copilot_layer.md` – Conceptual documentation and decision tree  
- `thinkingcoin_incentive.py` – Optional logic for user/developer rewards

## 🧠 Why It Matters
This isn't just code security—it's the beginning of *reasoning-aware finance*.  
Code trusted. Reasoning earned. DeFi evolves.
